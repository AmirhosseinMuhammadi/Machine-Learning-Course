# Foundations of Representation Learning
Foundations of Representation Learning is a narrative-driven course that unfolds like a novel. Unlike traditional categorization-based approaches (supervised vs unsupervised), this course follows a conceptual storyline grounded in modern representation learning principles. The curriculum emphasizes end-to-end projects and practical implementation over theoretical categorization.

## Course Narrative
This course takes you on a journey through the fundamental concepts of representation learning, building each chapter upon the previous one to create a cohesive understanding of how modern AI systems learn and represent information.

The course is organized into the following chapters, each expressed in separate Jupyter notebooks.
- Chapter 1: Introdoction
- Chapter 2: Python Essentials
- Chapter 3: Linearity
- Chapter 4: Non-linearity
- Chapter 5: Curse of Dimensionality
- Chapter 6: Unsupervised Learning
- Chapter 7: Sequences and Creativity
- Chapter 8: Agentic AI
